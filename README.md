## Things to Note
### Starting from version 2.1, you can now use this extension in macOS opera. Plus a little add-on of options settings.
### You don't have to worry too much. As long as your college doesn't change its HTML structure, this extension will still work. (Hopefully)
> By the way, I'm just a beginner in coding. I apologize if the extension stopped working halfway. In a event of extension working problem, please post your issue to this git's issues tab. Thank you.

### Additional Note: The extension files should be inside of a folder. Please note that if you're on Windows and you try to unzip the `suminyak-master.zip` file. 
#### You may get the file array like `[Folder\Folder\Extension Files]` which is not something we wanted.
#### What we need correctly is `[Folder\Extension Files]`. Please check carefully.

## Usage of extension
Typically this extension won't do anything until the website you are surfing matches `www.icom.org.cn` or `icom.org.cn`
1. So just login to your coda as usual. 
2. Then, once you're in the [Semester] Page. We'll have to part ways for **Chrome** and **Opera or Opera GX** now.

### For Chrome
> Your college has set a special function called `return popup2` instead of the standard `<a href>` that basically call a new popup window once you click the `bahbah.pdf` link on the [Semester] page. Making all the toolbar being disappeared on the new popup page.

If you don't understand anything above, it's okay. 

Just before you click the juicy `.pdf` link to your assessment or course description.

Press and hold down [`⌘` for macOS, `CTRL` for Windows] while left-click the `.pdf` link. So that the pdf link will be **opened in a new tab** rather than a **new popup window**.

Then once the page loads a bit, you can just click the *juicy* Soon head icon from the top-right.

Alternatively, you can choose how the extension acts up according to your needs. 

Just click the little **settings** button at the **top-right** of the window and configure it to your taste.

Finally, just click **[Go Back]** and click **[Music]** then wait for it to do the process!

### For Opera or Opera GX

> Actually, this browser is a bit special that it still has the toolbar present after loading up popup windows.

So that means, you can just follow the **For Chrome** usage guide above. 

But, there's only one difference. And that's you don't have to open the `.pdf` link in a new tab in order to use the extension. 

You can just click the `.pdf` link regularly and continue the steps. Although you can still open it in a new tab if you want to.

And that's it. Enjoy boiii.
